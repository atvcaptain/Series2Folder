# fileScreens is a simple database controlling how Series2Folder interacts
# with other classes that view or manipulate the filesystem.

# It is intended to do two jobs:
#  * In background mode, if any screen in either self.session.current_dialog
#    or self.session.dialog_stack is an instance of any class in any
#    value part of fileScreens, any background run of Series2Folder
#    will be deferred until none of those screens is in the current
#    stack of active screens.
#
#  * When run manually, the keys in fileScreens are the names of the
#    refresh methods to run in the listed classes in the value tuple
#    in order to refresh the selection list after Series2Folder does
#    the manual update.

# fileScreenTemplates is used to create fileScreens.  It is a tuple
# of tuples in the form:
#    (moduleName, tuple of screenClassNames, refreshMethodName)
# If refreshMethodName is None, then the entry is only used for
# preventing Series2Folder from running when the screen is active.
